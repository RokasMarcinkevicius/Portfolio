Hey there!
This is a GitHub Repository created in order to display my SSH knowledge &amp; experience.

It contains all that I know about SSH:

SSH -Tasks-
1. An example task for past Shell Connection sorting, display and grouping
2. Script for Indefinite User interaction with Keyboard Input
3. An example task for Shell permissions, their usage and modification
4. C script in shell for Child Process Creation

This Readme file is updated when the repository is filled.
