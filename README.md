# Portfolio
Hey there!
This is a GitHub Repository created in order to display my code/algorithm knowledge &amp; experience.

It contains all that I know about code separated into languages, which are then separated into subtopics:
---Java---
1. Basics (syntax, data types, constants, classes, cycles, dinamic arrays)
2. Algorithms(path find, djikstra, quick sort)
3. Text operations

---SSH---
1...
2...
3...

---Python---

This Readme file is updated when the repository is filled.
