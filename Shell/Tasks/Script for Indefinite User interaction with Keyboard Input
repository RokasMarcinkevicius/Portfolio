/* An example task for a Shell Script with User interaction, keyboard input */
/* Task:
--- displays prompt and reads numbers from a standart input (not command line arguments) until empty line is entered;
--- displays numbers on the standard output if the number entered is greater or lower than any number entered before (other numbers are discarded);
--- first number entered should be displayed/marked either as a special case (not the greatest or the lowest).
--- wrong input (non numeric strings) should be ignored.
*/
/* Sample session:
./script.sh
Enter numbers:
5
=== 5
8
+++ 8
4
--- 4
7
8
aaa
9
+++ 9

Program finished.
(Here lines containing only a number, string "aaa" and empty line are entered by a user;
"===" marks a special case, "+++" the greatest number, "---" the lowest number).
